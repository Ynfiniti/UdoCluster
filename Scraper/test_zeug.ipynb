IF you don't read the English subtitles (which are needless, anyhow) or listen to the Italian dialogue of \"The Steppe,\" which opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema and the 55th Street Playhouse yesterday, you may very well think you are looking at a genuine Soviet film, complete with the usual feel for nature and a touch of socialist ideology.For this handsome color picture, which Alberto Lattuada has made from a story by Chekhov, much of it shot in Yugoslavia, does a beautiful job of capturing the atmosphere of the Russian steppe, as we've seen it in Soviet pictures), the look of the Russian peasantry as it was in the late 19th century, a sense of the peasant's earthiness and a creepy awareness of the peonage in which the peasant was held by the merchant class.And also, as with some Soviet pictures, there's not much of a story here ï¿½ just a random and vivid documentation of social conditions and atmosphere.All that the picture is, precisely, is an intimate and hit-or-miss account of a journey made by a small boy, maybe 8 or 10 years old, via carriage first and then in a wagon train hauling wool across the windy steppe, from his home in an inland village to a market city where he is to go to school.And all that it offers in the way of substance is the many sights he sees, the intimations of human nature that are presented to him and a few hints of the emotions he feels.There's the haughtiness of his merchant uncle into whose care he is put and the gentleness of the old priest who is going along to sell some wool. There's the lustiness of the wagon drivers, their roaring, childlike delight in a chance to jump into a stream and go swimming or dance with the pretty girls at a village fair. And there's the brutality of a farm owner, the fatalism of the drivers themselves when they leave one of their own to die by the roadside and the shock of discovering the fact of death.It is not a suspenseful picture. It is not the least bit concerned with plot. Nor is Chekhov's story, for that matter.It is simply an engrossing report, always interesting, colorful and vivid, and it is simply and nicely performed by Daniel Spollone as the broadfaced, sturdy youngster and by the dozens of other people who turn up. Conspicuous among them are Pavlo Vuisic as the uncle, Charles Vanel as the priest and a big blond brute named Dimov as the noisiest wagoneer.Typical of 19th-century Russia, it is fatalistic and with no specific moral. \"The steppe, it's like life,\" says the old priest, \"you press on and on, but it's always the same.\"That's pretty much how it is with the picture, but, like life, it is eventful and interesting.    article on typical bookmaker  USSR gets $30 million worth of slaughterhouse equipment from Sweden FBI and local officials surprised by 2 state police arrests in connection with bombings, Birmingham; 2 identified as R E Chambliss and C Cagle  YORK, Pa., Sept. 30--Meshulam Riklis, doughty chairman of the McCrory Corporation, lost the biggest battle of his career today when he was defeated on his proposal to sell a major division to the Glen Alden Corporation.

Joey Bishop is giving a supposedly comic spiel as a used car salesman and flirting ineffectively with a pretty girl. Mort Sahl, abandoning his usual sardonic style, is giving a \"sincere\" reading to a two-minute death scene.These misguided performers, as well as Jim Backus, Wanda Hendrix, Elisha Cook Jr., Marc Lawrence and Telly Savalas, have been dragged in as a desperate attempt to camouflage a low budget melodrama that would otherwise be remarkable only for its dogged avoidance of anything unusual.The usually villainous Henry Silva, an odd choice for a romantic tough guy role, compensates by playing it in a single stoic expression. As a Sicilian bandit chosen to lead a vendetta upon the American underworld for a bitter deported gangster, he darts about New York, Las Vegas and Newport, stabbing, shooting and bombing his victims without a flicker of an eyelash.Under the flaccid direction of William Asher, a very attractive young actress, Elizabeth Montgomery, regards the proceedings with understandable alarm. If her simulated passion for her peculiar leading man seems less than convincing, she may be forgiven in view of the circumstancesï¿½particularly when she does her soul-searching wearing nothing more than a becoming lap robe.Peter Lawford, who unexpectedly produced this collage, might well have taken a look at the rushes and saved himself the expense of a fairly elaborate group of \"guest stars.\" Miss Montgomery, without benefit of wardrobe, attracts more attention than the entire uncomfortable array. The First National City Bank reported yesterday that net operating earnings for the first nine months of 1963 rose to $57,348,000, or $4.40 a share, compared with $52,781,000, or $4.05 a share, in the same period of 1962.   Indonesian spokesman says Govt defers action on restoring ties with Malaysia  Don't waste time on a wretched little Viking adventure called \"Erik the Conqueror.\" Fresh ï¿½ or fairly fresh ï¿½from Italy, with Hollywood's Cameron Mitchell dodging and outchopping an army of milling Italians, it opened on a neighborhood double bill yesterday. On this program it's \"The Castilian\" that counts.Considering the trash that thunders in from overseas, blanketing history with sex and gore, this Spanish-made adventure-drama is ï¿½ for about two-thirds of the timeï¿½surprisingly sensible, even literate, with a curious natural dignity. But compared with the mighty \"El Cid,\" whose setting, hero and plot it practically duplicates, this Warner presentation is a mere drop in the bucket.The opening, in fact, spells doom. Garbled as a 10-century Spanish minstrel, Frankie Avalon (with \"Beach Party\" still warm) strums a guitar and proceeds to telegraph the storyï¿½that of a legendary Castilian warrior who unites Spain against the Moors and wins a luscious princess.Thanks mainly to an articulate script, full of historical footnotes, and the easy locomotion of a capable cast against some striking settings, this color picture has visual charm and genuine period flavor. The incidents, in the main, balance the romance of the two young principals (Spartaco Santony and Teresa Velasquez) against a welter of intramural court intrigue before the final routing of the Moors.For his unobtrusive guidance, amid rattling sabers and royal double-crossing, and for the adroit way he fits his cast into the decor and landscape, Javier Seto, the co-scenarist and director, is the real hero. There's only one serious snagï¿½a drawn-out soul-searching sequence on a hilltop just before the big battle. The picture is much too long.As the brave warrior who saves Spain, Mr. Santony is earnest and manly. Cesar Romero, as his faithful sidekick, is his smooth, professional self. Miss Velasquez is a fiery eyeful. Only Alida Valli and Broderick Crawford don't mesh with the proceedings.The dubbed English is good. It even makes sense. Most of the way, \"The Castilian\" is easy on the ear and eye.

And the few sudden flashes of action and violence that do occur are done in the style of the Kabuki theater, which is flamboyant and wild.Thus the long build-up of resentment of a young lord against the shogun is wearily deadpanned and postured until suddenly his passion erupts and he has at the venal old fellow in a flailing and grunting rage. Or the secret recruitment of clansmen by the young lord's chief retainer to avenge his enforced suicide is long and tedious until the rebels burst loose in one big rush and do a bit of castle-besieging before the picture concludes solemnly.It makes for dull drama for my more remote occidental taste, and, by our standards, it is weirdly played by a cast of distinguished Japanese artists headed by Koshiro Matsumoto, who plays the chief retainer. Toshiro Mifune, well-known from other Japanese films, has a small role, again as a samurai whose sword is for sale.But the director, Hiroshi Inagaki, has made it a scenic feast. The ancient Japanese buildings, the stylized gardens, the exquisite costumes in vivid basic colors and breathtakingly delicate pastels are a constant flow of satisfaction for the appreciative eye.This is the most tastefully, subtly designed Japanese film since the memorable \"Gate of Hell.\" But, unfortunately, it has none of the sensitive and intense human tension that was in that film. It stands as a cold and clumsy drama in the Japanese epic style.Sometimes unintentionally amusing English subtitles translate the Japanese dialogue.

E N Beesley named dir IF you find yourself thinking of \"Rififi\" while watching \"Any Number Can Win,\" the new French crime melodrama that came to the Sutton yesterday, don't be amazed at your perception. You won't be the first to note the close and not unfavorable resemblance between these two robbery films.Indeed, I suspect the first persons to whom the similarity occurred were Jacques Bar, who produced the present picture, an dHenri Vernuil, who directed it. And I further suspect they were quite happy that a resemblance was in their script and they did all they could to emphasize itï¿½without being too obvious, of course.But never fear. This will not encumber your enjoyment of the film, which is set on the Riviera and was known in France as \"Melodie en Sous-Sol.\" It spins off a slick and suspenseful tale of robbing the casino at Cannes, and it is stunningly played by two experts, Jean Cabin and Alain Delon.One of the nicest things about it is that it was shot in Cannes, in and around the casino and along the sparkling Croisette, the beautiful palm-fringed avenue that arcs around the bay. As a consequence, it has the true appearance, the dazzling, freshly scrubbed look of the lovely resort, with its mountains looming majestically behind.It also has the tangy flavor of the gaming halls, the air of anxiety of its patrons, the glitter of the casino's big night club, the crispness of the swimming pools at seaside, the elegance of the luxury hotels. And it has enough girls in brief bikinis and night-club dancers in long black tights to fill the air with their vibrations and let you know you're in no other place.As for the melodrama, it too, has the captivating air of professional arrangement and performance, very carefully calculated and sure to do. From the moment we see Mr. Gabin coming home from a stretch in jail and confiding to his wife, Viviane Romance, that he has to pull one more big job, we feel that the engineering of the robbery-to-be is in the best of hands and that its execution will be performed like a symphony.And it is, from the cautious recruitment of his young jail companion, Mr. Delon, and the shift of their operations to the amiable area of Cannes, right through to the split-second timing of that descent down the elevator shaft into the casino's vault, the cramming of the banknotes into satchels and the fast get-away in a Rolls-Royce.Mr. Verneuil has paced the whole thing nicely, a little slowly at the start, a bit capriciously in the middle section when he has a casual Mr. Delon dallying a trifle too seriously with one of the dancing girls, Carla Marlier, and then swiftly, with tension in the jazz score, as the \"big grab\" is done. It is not as intense as \"Rififi,\" but it is in the general mood.And, of course, there is The Endingï¿½one of those bitter ironic twists that should serve to discourage other felons from wanting to rob the casino at Cannes. Whether it does or not is incidental. It makes a suitable climax for the film. Everybody can go home feeling richer for a tingling experience, anyhow.

They do it in \"The Devil and the 10 Commandments,\" which came to the Paris yesterday.At the start of this two-hour, picture, made up of seven vignettes, each supposedly concerned with a major or minor sin, a snake wiggles out of the mouth of a gargoyle and, speaking in French (with English subtitles), proclaims that it is our old friend, the Devil, and that it is going to show some evidence of its work. (Of course, it says a lot more, in slyly oblique, sardonic terms, but that's when it starts to get roguish and a little hard to comprehend.)And then the film presents us with this succession of short to long vignettes in which the displays of misbehavior range from deadly to dull.There's the first one in which Michel Simon, who looks like a great, benign toad, blasphemes beyond the endurance of the mother superior of a nunnery in which he works and has to be mildly reprimanded by a bishop who was his boyhood friend. And there's the second, in which a prissy fellow, Henri Tissot, follows a strip-tease artist home and finds that she is married to a dull custodian. Both are equally banal.Next is the deadly item. In this one, Charles Aznavour plays a meek chap who gives up the priesthood in order to get revenge upon the man who has foully corrupted his sister and caused her to commit suicide.The method he chooses is Draconianï¿½self-sacrificial, indeedï¿½and so utterly obvious and romantic it amounts to a big, fat clichï¿½. And that is the charge to be leveled against most of the other episodes.One that seems to give the most promiseï¿½one in which our old friend, Fernandel, turns up at an Alpine peasant's cottage and brings harmony to a bitter family by fobbing himself off as Godï¿½concludes with a gimmick so corny it could finish a burlesque skit. Even Fernandel, a shameless actor, turns his head when it is pulled.Several good actors are wasted in two of the other vignettes, both of them written so poorly they barely make fictional sense. In one, Franï¿½oise Arnoul, Micheline Presle, Mel Ferrer and Claude Dauphin go through a lengthy, tedious business of exchanging infidelities and jewels; and in the other, Danielle Darrieux and Alain Delon do a bit about an aging actress being encountered by her illegitimate son.The only vignette of the seven that tickled me at all was the last in which Louis de Funes and Jean-Claude Brialy play a couple of comedy crooks wo have a tug-of-war over a satchelful of money taken from a bank, and then see it get away from them in a typically farcical twist.But the several guffaws that are triggered by this rapidly paced little skit are slight compensation for the previous tedium.

Riegel Paper raises some prices SATYAJIT RAY'S wistful feelings for the old ways of life in India, for the troubled souls of a sensitive people confronted with great social change, are revealed again in another of his slow, sad and lovely Indian films, \"The Music Room,\" which opened at the Carnegie Hall Cinema yesterday.But this time his interest is centered not in the great middle class that provided the proud and patient subjects for his classic \"Apu\" trilogy and his more recent \"Devi\" and \"Two Daughters.\" Here he is augustly concerned with the tragic decay of a great landowner who cannot adjust to change.In this pathetic individual, Mr. Ray presents us with a man whose way of preserving an illusion of his grandeur and aristocracy ï¿½ and also of lording it over a new-rich neighbor whom he haughtily resents ï¿½ is to give expensive musicales in the richly ornamented music room of his great, crumbling palace that sits forlornly amid its barren river-valley fields.Here, without money and with few servants to tend the exhausted estate, and with only one elephant and one white stallion as mementos of its past, he persists in indulging his fancy. He pawns his wife's few remaining jewels to pay for the entertainers for the \"sacred thread\" ceremony to introduce his only son. And then, when his wife and son have been drowned and he himself has rested motionless for years, he sells all that's left and has one last fling of musical elegance before consigning himself to ruin.Although it appears the personal drama of only this one stubborn man, proud and essentially selfish in his obsession with his family and his class, Mr. Ray has made his picture speak a stately and haunting threnody for the noble tradition of music in the cultural life of India in the past. And, as he has fashioned his picture, the jalsaghar (the music room) is the obvious symbolization of a richness and beauty that are gone.It is in and around this splendid chamber that the whole film serenely, slowly turns, never getting much farther from it than the broad terraces that face the empty fields. It is here that the noble landowner first walks in lordly pride, preening himself before its mirrors, giving audience to his neighbor with stiff elan.It is here that he has his guests assemble for that dearly-paid-for musicale, drenched with the sad strains of the vina (the great gourd-shaped stringed instrument) and the pulsing rhythms of the tabla (drums). It is outside this room that he gets the cruel word of the death of his wife and son. And it is here that he makes his last obeissance to the portraits of his ancestors and has his last glorious musicale.Mr. Ray has based his picture upon a novel by Tarashankar Banerjee, but, like Luchino Visconti's \"The Leopard,\" it is a thing of his own design and mood. Pauses and silences mark it as often and eloquently as the measured scenes of human action and the strange performances at the musicales.There is no end to its rich, poetic, heart-piercing scenes and passages, no end of subtle combinations of music and images. And the performances, too, are superior, from that of Chabi Biswas, who plays the majestic and tragic landowner, to that of Roshan Kumari, who does the spectacular barefoot dance that completes the final musicale.The wife, played by Padma Devi, and the son, played by Pinaki Sen Gupta, add an immeasurable pathos, even though they appear in only a few brief scenes.As with all of Ray's pictures, the pace is exceedingly slow, the dramatic crises understated, the drama itself bare-boned. Those unaccustomed to his tempo may fidget for a little more speed and those used to music of the Western world may become impatient with the monophony of the music here. But, for all its exotic stimulations, it is an exceedingly simple, moving film, expressing a human dilemma that should be comprehensible to all.Also on the bill is \"The World of Rubens,\" a 20-minute black-and-white short that explains the life of Peter Paul Rubens, the great Flemish painter, in a vast array of still photographs of his works.

It is brisk, realistic, pictorially sharp. The camera is simply an observer from the opening shot. The viewer is kept at every moment in the position of a looker-on, never made a vicarious participant in the emotions of the people involved. And the narrative line is consistently that of as sembled facts, the truth.All Mr. Olmi shows us are a few crisp and crucial episodes. There's the whole strange and crowded experience of the lad on the day he goes to take the competitive examinations required of all applicants for a job ï¿½ his getting up in the morning, his going into the city on a suburban train, his watching the other applicants, his taking the silly exams, his meeting a girl, walking with her and finding himself fall ing in love.Then there's the subsequent business of going to the city a few days later to find out how he did, seeing the girl again, learning that both of them have jobs but in different plants, starting in as an errand boy and observing the routines of the white-collar clerks.And finally there's a search ing documentation of his experiences at an office party on New Year's Eve, waiting hopefully and sadly for the girl who never appears, and then a terminal scene showing what happens when he is promoted to the job of a clerk.That's it ï¿½ a simple, literal recount of the things that happen to this lad starting out on the big industrial treadmill that seems so awesome and desirable at the start.And yet, underneath the literal detail ï¿½ underneath the hundreds and hundreds of just-right bits of documen tary information about this lad and the people he meetsï¿½there comes into intellectual focus a profound comprehen sion of the youth, of his anxieties, fears and excitements and a lesser comprehension of the girl.So trenchant is Mr. Olmi's camera and so sensitive and subtle is he in directing his actors to give him precisely the right attitudes and looks, that every small thing we see, every gesture, every expression of the boy and the girl ï¿½ and, indeed, of the people around them ï¿½ contributes to the formation of an in tensely vivid impression of being present and watching their lives unfold.And as we feel this ï¿½ as we find ourselves reacting with the sympathy of a parent or a friend to the poignant experiences of the youngsters and to the sad exposures of the petty existences of the clerks ï¿½ we sense a piercing awareness of the terrible monotony of the routine that quietly traps the white-collar worker and channels youth into the oblivion of old age.Mr. Olmi is clearly an artist with the seeing-eye camera and he appears to be as skillful as Vittorio de Sica in getting inexperienced people to act. Fron Sandro Panzeri, a fledgling actor who bears a haunting resemblance to the late Gï¿½rard Philipe, especially in the sad expression around the eyes, he has got so much natural behavior, so much revelation of a youngster's whims and moods that one comes away from the picture with a sense of knowing this boy.And he has got Loredana Detto (who happens to be his wife) to give a thoroughly entrancing suggestion of the pathetically elusive girl.Others, whose names aren't even mentioned, are perfect in other roles. I'd like to cite every one who is present at that office party, for instance. It's a gem.One hesitates, of course, to be too clamorous about Mr. Olmi on the strength of this one film. It is modest in its intentions, limited in its scope. But it clearly reveals a picturemaker who knows how to make a camera see the poetry in life and hint at vain longings and ironies too sad and depressing to tell. The monotonous thump of the rotor on a mimeograph machine is the visual and aural symbol with which the picture ends.(Mr. Olmi's second feature film, \"The Fiancï¿½s,\" was shown at the First New York Film Festival. It is due for release this fall.)   airline end airplane mfrs reprs score 'staggering risks' in cost-sharing plan, subcom  V von Hoevel, A Frank Soc employe, seized on charge of using soc's presses to mfr W Ger bank notes     SPESBACH, Germany, Oct. 23 Troops of the Second Armored Division, a few hours after having been flown in from Fort Hood, Tex., began loading ammunition today aboard tanks drawn from stocks here.   bus workers co-op, organized to take over Valencia munic transit system, is 1st such co-op estab under Franco regime stage 24-hr strike over wages  Reports were confirmed yesterday that Tallulah Bankhead would return to Broadway in the revised version of Tennessee Williams's \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More.\"   Govt com headed by Lord Robbins urges raising number of univs from 32 to 60 by '80 to permit enrollment of 560,000 full-time students as against 216,000 now; puts initial cost at almost $4 billion, rise in yrly operating cost at $1.4 million; most of funds to come from Govt; other details co consol with Altamil Corp approved by dirs of both 30-newspaper co-op project Newspaper 1 plans $250,000 media-mkt research program Show Holiday on Ice to tour USSR in May-June under cultural exch program ground broken, Manhattan store 5.83 million BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Oct. 23 (UPI) A city councilman confirmed today the prediction of the Rev.

CHICAGO, Oct, 23 (UPI)  Most corn and oats were firm while other grain futures slipped today on the Board of Trade.   San Francisco   \"X ï¿½ THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES\" is not Ben Turpin. It's Ray Milland, no less, as a surgeon whose altruistic drug experiments on himself are his downfall. And up to the mid-point, this fantasy-melodrama is surprisingly level-headed and persuasive in its restraint and succinct dialogue. Along with another American-International offering, \"Dementia 13,\" it opened yesterday at the Palace and other houses.Let's treat \"Dementia\" first. Don't ask what that title means ï¿½ or whatever happened to the first 12 dementias. One is enough. A jittery family, including a greedy in-law, prowl around a Gothic estate in Ireland (where the picture was photographed), stalked by an ax-happy mystery swinger. And does he (or she) swing it!Under the stolid direction of Francis Coppola, who also wrote the script, the picture stresses gore rather than atmosphere, and all but buries a fairly workable plot. William Campbell and Luana Anders head the unlucky cast.Mr. Milland's vehicle is, despite the title, no hard-breathing shocker. Alertly directed and produced, in color, by Roger Corman, it shapes up as a modern parable about a dedicated doctor done in by humanity after he tampers with the unknown. As written by Robert Dillon and Ray Russell, the concept is original and the tone is thoughtful. So, most persuasively, is Mr. Milland.Initially the picture is on firm ground, as a concerned colleague (Harold J. Stone) warns his friend that the supernatural belongs to the gods. \"Well, I'm closing in on the gods,\" retorts Mr. Milland and does so, with his eye-dropper.The meatiest and most provocative sequence is Mr. Milland's stint, after he runs afoul of the law, as a medical analyst for a grasping carnival boss, well-played by Don Rickles.Unfortunately, with Mr. Milland in agony and full flight from the law, the picture careens rather theatrically, underscored by spooky music and some shrill \"angel\" voices. Mr. Milland's curtain speech, in a church, is both moving and a wrenching eye-opener.Mr. Stone and Diana Van Der Vlis give Mr. Milland professional support in an odd little movie that aims for sensible novelty and to some extent succeeds.
